## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
Nothing special here on this challenge
```

```css
.tried-to-use-clamp {
	font-size: clamp(12px, 1.1vw, 14px);
}

First time using this css property. The challenge asked for a responsive font-size without using media queries. Found this property to be the most suitable after doing some research. Still trying to understand how it works.
```

### Continued development

I am going to work more on responsiveness with media queries and properties like clamp.

I will also dive a bit more into Figma to understand how to better use it and get the most out of the figma files.

### Useful resources
