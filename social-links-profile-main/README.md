## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
First time trying to use semantic html. Makes the code much clearer.
```

```css
I used :root and @font-face for the first time

```

### Continued development

I am going to work more on responsiveness with media queries and properties like clamp.

I will also dive a bit more into Figma to understand how to better use it and get the most out of the figma files.
