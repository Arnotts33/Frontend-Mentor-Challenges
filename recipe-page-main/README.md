## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
Use of table and semantic html
```

```css
    Styling the table and the lists was quite challenging

```

### Continued development

I think I lost quite some time to try to be as close as possible to the design. I will try to split my css in different files.
