					I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I

					“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
					I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
					people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
					the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
					enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
					- and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
					course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
					Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

					Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

				<p class="user-testimonial">
					“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
					code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
					help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
					enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
					wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
					and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
					never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
					project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
					to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
					In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
					example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me
					land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
					multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
