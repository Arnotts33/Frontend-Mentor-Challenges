### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
Structured with semantic HTML and finding class or id names to work with JS
```

```css
Worked with flex grid and managed to get good responsiveness layouts
Proud of my floating "share" bar
```

```js
Happy to get it working on toggle.
```

### Continued development

HTML / CSS: More work on good class and id names

JS: More work and learning needed on JS to make it work with a shorter and more efficient code.
