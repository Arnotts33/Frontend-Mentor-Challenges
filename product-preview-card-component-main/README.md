## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./images/product-card.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   Getting better with the use of semantic html.
-   Use of data attributes in html to work with it in the css.
-   Use of <source> tag to work with images of different sizes (mobile/desktop).
-   Workflow: Mobile first.

```html
data-icon
<source />
```

```css
mobile firstt
```

### Continued development

For the next project, I might try to work my CSS in different files.
